# OpenConference-web
Web frontend and backend for OpenConference

This repository should consist of two parts:
 1. Backend
 2. Web-Frontend
 
This backend should serve data for [Android client](https://github.com/OpenConference/OpenConference-android) and [iOS client](https://github.com/OpenConference/OpenConference-ios)
as well as providing a web frontend.


We haven't started working on that yet, but we are looking for contributors. If you are interessted in, please file an issue here on github.
